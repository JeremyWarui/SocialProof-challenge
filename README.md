## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I can use two images in background-image property.
background-image:url(image), url(image)

Use of flex-box in aligning items. Ilign items is for aligning vertically while justify is for aligning horizontally

### Continued development

Working more on flexbox and use of CSS Grids would be more fun in using them. I am not comfortable yet on using them but the challenge is worth it. Looking forward for more
hen you look back on this project in the future.**
